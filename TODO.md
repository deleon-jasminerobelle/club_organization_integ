# API Endpoint Fixes - Progress Tracking

## Current Status Analysis
- ✅ API Route: `/api/students` (correctly defined in routes/api.php)
- ✅ Frontend: Calling `/api/students` (correct in signup.blade.php)
- ✅ AuthController: Updated to use HTTPS for external API (`https://pupt-registration.site`)
- ✅ Documentation: Updated to show `/api/students` (was `/api/signup`)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated SIGNUP_API_DOCUMENTATION.md to reflect correct endpoint `/api/students`
- [x] Updated AuthController to use HTTPS (`https://pupt-registration.site`) instead of HTTP
- [x] Fixed both signup() and login() methods to use correct HTTPS URL
- [x] Removed "Officers" link from navigation in all relevant views.

## Verification Needed
- [ ] Test signup functionality to ensure it works with `/api/students` endpoint
- [ ] Verify external API connection is working properly with HTTPS
- [ ] Ensure API_KEY environment variable is properly configured

## Additional Findings
- Web route `/signup` exists and serves the signup form
- API route `/api/user` exists for authenticated user data (Sanctum)
- No other user creation endpoints found besides `/api/students`

## Testing Commands
To test the API endpoint (PowerShell):
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/students" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"email": "test@example.com", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "student_number": "2024-00123", "program": "Computer Science", "year": "1st Year", "section": 1, "birthdate": "2005-01-15"}'
```

## Environment Configuration Required
Make sure your `.env` file has:
```env
API_URL=https://pupt-registration.site
API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
